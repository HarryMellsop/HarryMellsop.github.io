            <div id="moreinfo">
                <p class="aboutme">I'm a Kiwi studying Economics and Computer Science in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University 🌲.</p>
                <p class="aboutme">I was born in Wellington and grew up in Auckland, 🇳🇿.  Up until recently I was living in Palo Alto, California, 🇺🇸 with my girlfriend, two of my close friends, and our cats, Maverick and Goose 🐱.  COVID-19 and subsequent law changes in the United States have turned my life upside down forcing me back to New Zealand, but I'm making the most of it.</p>
                <p class="aboutme">I'm currently employed by Amazon's Lab126, working on software engineering for Amazon FireTV.</p>
                <p class="aboutme">I'm a Student Founder in Residence at StartX, have founded/co-founded 3 startups (in the VR/AR, social media and software engineering spaces), and am passionate about using entrepreneurship and technology to solve real human need.  I'm currently working on a plan to use artificial intelligence to assist with pricing fairer bridging credit in the low-income, unsecured loan space.</p>
                <p class="aboutme">I love cycling 🚴‍♀️, mountain biking 🚵‍♀️, skiing ⛷ and diving 🌊, particularly with friends and family.</p>
                <p class="aboutme">I've always had a love of engineering, but I'm particularly passionate about aircraft.  Consequently, I'm currently working on getting my private pilot's license 🛫.</p>
                <p class="aboutme">You can read an amalgamation of eclectic thoughts in The Void, linked below. I thought the name was fitting given my writing is likely to only ever be read by me, but I hope some of what I write might be read and appreciated by others.</p>
